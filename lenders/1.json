I certainly agree with the saying - 'An un-examined life is a life un-lived'.\r\n\r\nI am ambitious, but not in the sense of 'getting'. More in the sense of 'being'. Being useful, being effective, being happy with myself, happy with others and happy with simply fulfilling my modest needs.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the Green Party (UK), and preferring the use of education and communication to bring about change, I take an active interest in many subjects.\r\n\r\nI prefer to concentrate my efforts and active participation to actively supporting Anti-Slavery International & The Orangutan Land Trust. I am also a member of Amnesty International.\r\n\r\nI am very excited to begin 2011 in a new direction and I now offer web design & development services to non-profit organisations and charities along with genuine ethical, green and social enterprises.\r\n\r\nI am also studying towards accreditation as a counsellor though this is a very new departure for me. I look forward to being able to help those who would benefit from a sympathetic ear in the future.\r\n\r\nI have found much guidance in Buddhism on the ephemiral nature of 'things' and have found much peace and contentment in simply striving for that which is needed and no more. This in turn, I find, allows me much more time and energy to be spent in pursuit of the making of a contribution in the areas that are of importance to me.\r\n\r\nMuch happier with less, I am very much looking forward to utilising my skills in web development, design and marketing for the benefit of organisations that share my concerns and ethos towards their operations.\r\n\r\nI am currently very interested in adding to my web portfolio so if you are involved in an organisation that may benefit from my skills, please do enquire. I may well feel moved to donate my time in return for the addition to my portfolio.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\r\n\r\nAndy.","loan_count":5,"invitee_count":0,"inviter_id":null},{"lender_id":"maryann","name":"MaryAnn Bailey","image":{"id":330829,"template_id":1},"whereabouts":"Seattle WA","country_code":"US","uid":"maryann","member_since":"2006-01-01T09:01:01Z","personal_url":"http:www.quietcourage.blogspot.com","occupation":"Life Coach","loan_because":"I have seen first hand the incredible impact a small amount of money can make in people's lives.","occupational_info":"I help people find the courage to achieve their dreams.","loan_count":1,"invitee_count":0,"inviter_id":null},{"lender_id":"colinrule","name":"Colin Rule","image":{"id":7792,"template_id":1},"whereabouts":"San Jose CA","country_code":"US","uid":"colinrule","member_since":"2006-01-01T09:01:01Z","personal_url":"cyberlaw.stanford.edu\/blog\/colin-rule","occupation":"Mediator","loan_because":"It\\'s such a small thing for me, but a big thing for the receiver.
